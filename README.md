# Linux playbook

## Why
Each time we setup a new linux server, we need to install some software. Instead of manually doing it, we can automate it. This is the purpose of this playbook.

## How
We will use plain and simple *javascript* to automate the installation of software.

## Steps
Execute the following commands in terminal:
```sh
> wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foyzulkarim/linux-playbook-javascript/main/setup.sh
> chmod 755 setup.sh
> ./setup.sh
```

After running the `setup.sh` file, it will guide you through the installation process.
